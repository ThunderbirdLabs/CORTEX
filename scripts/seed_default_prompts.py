Below are answers from sub-questions (not raw documents):
---------------------
{{context_str}}
---------------------

Given the information above and not prior knowledge, create a comprehensive, conversational response that synthesizes these sub-answers.

QUOTING POLICY:
- Use direct quotes when they add value: specific numbers, impactful statements, unique insights
- Keep quotes to 1-2 full sentences maximum
- Don't quote mundane facts or simple status updates
- The sub-answers already contain quotes - use them when relevant

SOURCING:
- The sub-answers may contain markdown links like "[Document Title](url)" - PRESERVE THESE EXACTLY
- If sub-answers don't have markdown links, cite sources naturally: "The ISO checklist shows..." or "According to the QC report..."
- Never break or modify existing markdown links from sub-answers
- Never use technical IDs like "document_id: 180"
- When combining information from multiple sources, cross-reference naturally

HANDLING GAPS:
- If sub-answers don't fully address the question, acknowledge what's missing
- Don't make up information not present in the context
- If sub-answers conflict, present both perspectives

STYLE:
- Conversational and direct - skip formal report language
- Make connections between different pieces of information
- Provide insights and suggestions
- Skip greetings and sign-offs

FORMATTING (markdown):
- Emoji section headers (üì¶ üö® üìä üöõ üí∞ ‚ö° üéØ) to organize
- **Bold** for important numbers, names, key points
- Bullet points and numbered lists for structure
- Tables for data comparisons
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå for status
- Code blocks for metrics/dates/technical details

and {{company_operations}}.

**ENTITY TYPES TO EXTRACT** ({{entity_types}}):

- Examples: "Acme Industries", "PolyPlastics Supply Co.", "Superior Mold", "TriStar"

- MUST BE: Actual job titles, not just department names
- Examples: "VP of Sales", "Quality Engineer", "Procurement Manager", "CEO", "Account Manager"

**PURCHASE_ORDER**:
- Purchase orders, invoices, PO numbers, quotes
- MUST BE: Actual PO numbers or invoice identifiers
- Examples: "PO-12345", "Invoice #8877", "Quote Q-2024-001"

**MATERIAL**:
- Physical materials, components, or products used in operations
- MUST BE: A tangible material or component with physical properties
- Examples: "polycarbonate PC-1000", "steel pellets", "resin", "molded connector housing"

- Quality certifications, standards, compliance documents
- MUST BE: Specific certification names or standards
- Examples: "ISO 9001:2015", "FDA approval", "UL certification", "CoC #12345"

**RELATIONSHIP TYPES**:

- **WORKS_FOR**: (PERSON, WORKS_FOR, COMPANY) - Employment relationship
- **HAS_ROLE**: (PERSON, HAS_ROLE, ROLE) - Job title/position
- **CREATED_BY**: (PURCHASE_ORDER, CREATED_BY, PERSON) - Who created/sent a document
- **SENT_TO**: (PURCHASE_ORDER, SENT_TO, COMPANY) - Document sent to company
- **SUPPLIES_TO**: (COMPANY, SUPPLIES_TO, COMPANY) - Supplier relationship
- **PROVIDES**: (COMPANY, PROVIDES, MATERIAL) - Company supplies a material
- **CERTIFIED_FOR**: (COMPANY or MATERIAL, CERTIFIED_FOR, CERTIFICATION) - Has certification
- **MENTIONS**: (Document, MENTIONS, any entity) - Entity mentioned in document

**EXTRACTION RULES**:

1. Extract ALL entities of the specified types that appear in the text
2. Create relationships ONLY between extracted entities (no orphan entities)
3. Focus on critical relationships (supply chain, materials, certifications)
4. Use exact names from the text - do NOT normalize or abbreviate
5. Skip generic terms that don't represent specific entities

**RELATIONSHIP VALIDATION**:

‚úÖ KEEP relationships that are:
- Explicit in the text
- Between two extracted entities
- Business-critical (who works where, who supplies what, etc.)

‚ùå SKIP relationships that are:
- Vague or implied (no supporting text)
- Involving generic terms ("the vendor", "our client")
- Not business-critical (casual mentions)

**EXAMPLES**:

Input: "Superior Mold supplies to Acme Corp and provided mold inserts."
Output:
- (Superior Mold, SUPPLIES_TO, Acme Corp)
- (Superior Mold, PROVIDES, mold inserts)

Input: "Kevin Trainor, VP of Sales, sent PO-5432 to Acme Industries."
Output:
- (Kevin Trainor, HAS_ROLE, VP of Sales)
- (PO-5432, CREATED_BY, Kevin Trainor)
- (PO-5432, SENT_TO, Acme Industries)
