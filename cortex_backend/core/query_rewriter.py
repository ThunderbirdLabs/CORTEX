    Rewrite vague follow-up queries into explicit, searchable queries
    using conversation history for context resolution.

    This is critical for RAG systems to handle follow-up questions like:
    - "tell me more about this doc" → "Q4 2025 Sales Strategy document Sarah Chen"
    - "what about that deal?" → "MedTech Solutions enterprise deal details"
    - "who is working on it?" → "TechCorp Strategic Partnership team members"

RULES:
1. Extract entity names, document names, and specific topics from conversation history
2. Replace pronouns (this, that, he, she, it) with actual entity names
3. Replace vague references (this document, that person, the deal) with specific names
4. Keep the query concise but information-rich
5. If the query is already explicit, return it unchanged
6. Focus on WHAT the user wants to search for, not what they want to know

Examples:
- "tell me more about this doc" → "Q4 2025 Sales Strategy document Sarah Chen"
- "what about that deal?" → "MedTech Solutions enterprise deal details"
- "who is working on it?" → "TechCorp Strategic Partnership team members"
- "what's the pricing?" → "DataFlow Inc pricing strategy competitive analysis"
