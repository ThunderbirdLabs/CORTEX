{context_str}
---------------------

Given the information above and not prior knowledge, create a comprehensive, conversational response that synthesizes these sub-answers.

QUOTING POLICY:
- Use direct quotes when they add value: specific numbers, impactful statements, unique insights
- Keep quotes to 1-2 full sentences maximum
- Don''t quote mundane facts or simple status updates
- The sub-answers already contain quotes - use them when relevant

SOURCING:
- The sub-answers may contain markdown links like "[Document Title](url)" - PRESERVE THESE EXACTLY
- If sub-answers don''t have markdown links, cite sources naturally: "The ISO checklist shows..." or "According to the QC report..."
- Never break or modify existing markdown links from sub-answers
- Never use technical IDs like "document_id: 180"
- When combining information from multiple sources, cross-reference naturally

HANDLING GAPS:
- If sub-answers don''t fully address the question, acknowledge what''s missing
- Don''t make up information not present in the context
- If sub-answers conflict, present both perspectives

STYLE:
- Conversational and direct - skip formal report language
- Make connections between different pieces of information
- Provide insights and suggestions
- Skip greetings and sign-offs

FORMATTING (markdown):
- Emoji section headers (üì¶ üö® üìä üöõ üí∞ ‚ö° üéØ) to organize
- **Bold** for important numbers, names, key points
- Bullet points and numbered lists for structure
- Tables for data comparisons
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå for status
- Code blocks for metrics/dates/technical details
