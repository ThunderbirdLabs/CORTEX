Below are answers from sub-questions (not raw documents):
---------------------
{{context_str}}
---------------------

Given the information above and not prior knowledge, create a comprehensive, conversational response that synthesizes these sub-answers.

QUOTING POLICY:
- Use direct quotes when they add value: specific numbers, impactful statements, unique insights
- Keep quotes to 1-2 full sentences maximum
- Don''t quote mundane facts or simple status updates
- The sub-answers already contain quotes - use them when relevant

SOURCING:
- The sub-answers may contain markdown links like "[Document Title](url)" - PRESERVE THESE EXACTLY
- If sub-answers don''t have markdown links, cite sources naturally: "The ISO checklist shows..." or "According to the QC report..."
- Never break or modify existing markdown links from sub-answers
- Never use technical IDs like "document_id: 180"
- When combining information from multiple sources, cross-reference naturally

HANDLING GAPS:
- If sub-answers don''t fully address the question, acknowledge what''s missing
- Don''t make up information not present in the context
- If sub-answers conflict, present both perspectives

STYLE:
- Conversational and direct - skip formal report language
- Make connections between different pieces of information
- Provide insights and suggestions
- Skip greetings and sign-offs

FORMATTING (markdown):
- Emoji section headers (üì¶ üö® üìä üöõ üí∞ ‚ö° üéØ) to organize
- **Bold** for important numbers, names, key points
- Bullet points and numbered lists for structure
- Tables for data comparisons
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå for status
- Code blocks for metrics/dates/technical details

**EXTRACTION RULES**:

3. Focus on critical relationships (supply chain, materials, certifications)
4. Use exact names from the text - do NOT normalize or abbreviate
5. Skip generic terms that don''t represent specific entities

**RELATIONSHIP VALIDATION**:

‚úÖ KEEP relationships that are:
- Explicit in the text
- Between two extracted entities
- Business-critical (who works where, who supplies what, etc.)

‚ùå SKIP relationships that are:
- Vague or implied (no supporting text)
- Involving generic terms ("the vendor", "our client")
- Not business-critical (casual mentions)

**EXAMPLES**:

Input: "Superior Mold supplies to Acme Corp and provided mold inserts."
Output:
- (Superior Mold, SUPPLIES_TO, Acme Corp)
- (Superior Mold, PROVIDES, mold inserts)

Input: "Kevin Trainor, VP of Sales, sent PO-5432 to Acme Industries."
Output:
- (Kevin Trainor, HAS_ROLE, VP of Sales)
- (PO-5432, CREATED_BY, Kevin Trainor)
- (PO-5432, SENT_TO, Acme Industries)
