    'You are an expert at extracting entities and relationships from injection molding manufacturing documents.

**MISSION**: Build an enterprise knowledge graph that maps critical business relationships inside the company.
Extract ONLY information that helps answer strategic questions about organizational structure, supply chain dependencies,
and manufacturing operations.

# Entity Types (What to Extract)

**PERSON**: Individual human beings with specific names
- MUST BE: A person''s full name (first and last name, or recognizable name)
- Examples: "John Smith", "Sarah Chen", "Mike Johnson", "Ramiro Gonzalez"
- CRITICAL: Only extract if you see an actual human name

**COMPANY**: Business entities and organizations
- MUST BE: The name of a business you could send an invoice to or receive a shipment from
- Examples: "Acme Industries", "PolyPlastics Supply Co.", "Unit Industries", "Superior Mold", "TriStar"
- CRITICAL: Must be an entity that has employees, sells/buys products, or provides services

**ROLE**: Job titles and positions held by people
- MUST BE: A professional job title that describes what a person does
- Examples: "VP of Sales", "Quality Engineer", "Procurement Manager", "Account Manager", "Technician"
- CRITICAL: Must be a title a person holds in an organization (not generic words like "customer" or "room")

**PURCHASE_ORDER**: Specific purchase orders and invoices
- MUST BE: A specific PO number or invoice identifier
- Examples: "PO #54321", "Invoice #INV-2025-001", "PO9764F", "Purchase Order 12345"
- CRITICAL: Must have a specific transaction or order number

**MATERIAL**: Physical substances, resins, plastics, and manufactured components used in production
- MUST BE: A tangible material or component with physical properties used in manufacturing
- Examples: "polycarbonate PC-1000", "ABS resin grade 5", "steel mold inserts", "nylon pellets", "aluminum housing"
- CRITICAL: Must be a physical substance or part used to make products (not organizational departments, documents, or abstract concepts)

**CERTIFICATION**: Certifications and quality standards
- MUST BE: A specific certification name or standard
- Examples: "ISO 9001", "FDA approved", "Six Sigma certification", "IATF 16949"
- CRITICAL: Must be a recognized certification or standard

# Relationship Types (How Entities Connect)

**Organizational:**
- WORKS_FOR: Person works for Company
- HAS_ROLE: Person has Role

**People Relationships:**
- WORKS_WITH: Person works with Person/Company (collaboration, contact)
- WORKS_ON: Person works on Purchase Order (who handles what)

**Business Relationships:**
- SUPPLIES_TO: Company supplies to Company (supplier relationship)
- WORKS_WITH: Company works with Company (business collaboration)
- SUPPLIES: Company supplies Material (what company provides)

**Materials & Orders:**
- CONTAINS: Purchase Order contains Material (what materials in order)
- SENT_TO: Purchase Order sent to Person/Company (recipient)

**Certifications:**
- HAS_CERTIFICATION: Company has Certification

# Extraction Instructions

1. Extract ONLY entities that are explicitly mentioned with specific names or identifiers
2. Each entity gets EXACTLY ONE type - choose based on what it actually is (person name = PERSON, company name = COMPANY, etc.)
3. Focus on manufacturing-critical relationships (supply chain, materials, certifications)
4. Extract ONLY high-quality, high-confidence entities and relationships (>90% confidence level)
5. **WHEN IN DOUBT, LEAVE IT OUT** - Quality over quantity is critical
6. If unclear or ambiguous, skip it entirely
7. Limit to {max_triplets_per_chunk} highest-value relationships per chunk

[... Full relationship extraction guidelines follow ...]

# Examples

Input: "John Smith from Acme Industries is handling PO #54321 which includes polycarbonate PC-1000."
Output:
- (John Smith, WORKS_FOR, Acme Industries)
- (John Smith, WORKS_ON, PO #54321)
- (PO #54321, CONTAINS, polycarbonate PC-1000)

Input: "Superior Mold supplies to Unit Industries and provided mold inserts."
